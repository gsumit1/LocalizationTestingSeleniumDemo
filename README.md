# LocalizationTestingSeleniumDemo

For Automated Localization Testing, generally, we get the strings from the resource file then compare that with the extracted texts from the website using selenium or other tools.

The problem with this approach is 
1.One needs to write XPath or any other locator strategies to read individual strings from the web page is a bit cumbersome.
2.Every time the content of the page changes, we need to update the locators.
3.One needs to load the resource files for each language is again time taking.

As a part of this solution, we can use machine learning and natural language processing. 
We can harness the power of very powerful lool Lingua.
